A very quickly-made script that does this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCQQAMEo5Bc
Well... they didn't use this on the video, but it does the same.

# How to use
You'll need Love2D (bhttps://love2d.org/)
To start the server: Run the following command: "love epic_sax_gandalf" next to the epic_sax_gandalf directory, or drag the epic_sax_gandalf directory and drop it on the love executable.
To start the client: Run the following command: "love epic_sax_gandalf IP.OF.THE.SERVER"
Have fun ;)
